templatescriptwebpart
=====================

This project will show how we are able to build powerfull web parts for office 365 using the script editor web part like a template

- you are able to get the wsp from [repo's bin](TilesWebPart_VS/TilesWebPart/bin), click on the file and after that on RAW
 
- the part uses a list created from sandboxed schema, so if the solution was removed, the tiles list will not work anymore
- a next version will solve this
